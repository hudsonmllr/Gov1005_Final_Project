# Demographic Comparison Between American Colleges and The U.S. Military
This project looks at the historical and curren demographic breakdowns between
the American military and universities. It also compares those two groups to the 
American population as a whole. The goal is to see how society has changed over the
years and attempt to learn from what has worked and what has not in order to
discover how to increase the levels of gender and racial diversity in both groups.
